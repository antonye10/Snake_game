# Snakegame
This program uses 6502js Assembly to create a snake game using the WASD keys for movement. The object of the game is to collect the flashing pixel (apple) and survive as long as possible without hitting the edges of the screen or yourself.

# Testing
This code can be tested using a [6502 Simulator](https://pixelatedrobot.com/6502js).
